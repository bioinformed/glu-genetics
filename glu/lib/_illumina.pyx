  '''
  String data are encoded as a sequence of one or more length bytes followed
  by the specified number of data bytes.

  The lower 7 bits of each length byte encodes the bits that comprise the
  length of the following byte string.  When the most significant bit it
  set, then an additional length byte follows with 7 additional high bits to
  be added to the current length.  The following string lenths are
  accommodated by increasing sequences of length bytes:

  length  maximum
  bytes   length
  ------  --------
    1       127 B
    2        16 KB
    3         2 MB
    4       256 MB
    5        32 GB

  While this seems like a sensible progression, there is some uncertainty
  about this interpretation, since the longest of string observed in the
  wild has been of length 6,264 with two length bytes.
